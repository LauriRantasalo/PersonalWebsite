        <div class="bigRight">
            I am creating a browser-based strategy game similar to a game I used to play as a child, called Travian. The frontend is made with Angular and backend with Django and the project will be hosted on AWS.
            During this project I have already learnt a great deal about both front- and backend development and I am learing more every day. 
            Angular's component system and Djangos excelent database management capabilities are in my opinion perfect for a project like this. <br> <br>
            I am keeping it as a private repository for now, so no code will be available at this time.

            This site was a quick project to more easily display what I am currently working on. 
            Angular frontend was probably a bit of an overkill for a simple website like this but I do have some plans that might need the capabilites it provides.
